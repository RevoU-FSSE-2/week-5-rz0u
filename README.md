## Website Building
This is a documentation on how i built my website from the ground up, the first step i did was adding a HTML boilerplate to my index.html file and from there i start making the HTML barebone such as navbar, header, main, section, and footer.

after that i start filling those tags with the content that i already have in mind, starting from the navbar

### Navigation Bar
```
<nav>
      <div class="logo-container"><img src="" alt="" /></div>
      <ul class="ul-navbar">
      </ul>
      <div class="hamburger">
      </div>
    </nav>
